list realization in three different ways: linked list, static array and dynamic array (vector).
There are basic methods for each realization:
	append()
	insert()
	get()
	set()
	remove()

TIME MEASUREMENT FOR LINKED LIST:
Number of operations = 1: 
	append(): 8
	insert(): 67
	get(): 3
	set(): 3
	remove(): 3
Number of operations = 10: 
	append(): 2
	insert(): 0.8
	get(): 0.6
	set(): 0.3
	remove(): 0.7
Number of operations = 100: 
	append(): 2
	insert(): 5.7
	get(): 4.4
	set(): 4.5
	remove(): 5.7

TIME MEASUREMENT FOR STATIC ARRAY:
Number of operations = 1: 
	append(): 42
	insert(): 2
	get(): 2
	set(): 2
	remove(): 1
Number of operations = 10: 
	append(): 0.4
	insert(): 0.7
	get(): 0.3
	set(): 0.4
	remove(): 0.7
Number of operations = 100: 
	append(): 0.06
	insert(): 2.07
	get(): 0.04
	set(): 0.05
	remove(): 1.76

TIME MEASUREMENT FOR DYNAMIC ARRAY:
Number of operations = 1: 
	append(): 68
	insert(): 4
	get(): 2
	set(): 2
	remove(): 3
Number of operations = 10: 
	append(): 0.5
	insert(): 0.6
	get(): 0.3
	set(): 0.3
	remove(): 0.7
Number of operations = 100: 
	append(): 0.18
	insert(): 2.82
	get(): 0.04
	set(): 0.06
	remove(): 3.57
